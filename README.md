# Docker Volume

Docker volumes are a popular and effective method for ensuring data persistence while working with containers. They provide a way to store and share data between containers and even persist data beyond the container lifecycle.

---

## **Installation**

To use Docker volumes, you must first install **Docker** and **Python**.

### **Step 1: Install Docker and Python**
Install both Docker and Python from their official sources:
- [Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### **Step 2: Verify Installations**
Once installed, verify their versions using the following commands:
```sh
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Python version
python --version
```

---

## **Docker Volume Deployment**

### **Step 1: Start a New Container**
Run the following command to start an interactive terminal session in a new Node.js container using the latest image:
```sh
docker run -it node:latest
```

### **Step 2: List All Containers**
To view all Docker containers (both running and stopped), use:
```sh
docker container ls -a
```
#### Example Output:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
8363fec86c40   node:latest    "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Exited (0) 24 seconds ago             inspiring_mccarthy
```

### **Step 3: Attach a Volume to a Container**
Mount a local directory as a volume inside a container:
```sh
docker run -it -v /Users/tanishqmacbook/Desktop/Docker_volume:/home/app node bash
```

### **Step 4: Create a Docker Volume**
Create a named volume for persistent storage:
```sh
docker volume create data
```

### **Step 5: Attach the Named Volume to a Container**
Mount the named volume **data** inside a container:
```sh
docker run -it -v data:/data node bash
```

### **Step 6: Use the Named Volume in Another Container**
To share the volume with another container, mount it in a new Ubuntu container:
```sh
docker run -it -v data:/myapp ubuntu
```

---

## **Conclusion**
Docker volumes provide an efficient way to persist and share data between containers. Using named volumes is the recommended approach for managing persistent data in containerized applications.
